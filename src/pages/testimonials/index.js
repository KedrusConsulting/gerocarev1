Gerocare went above and beyond to provide top-notch care. Our mom's doctor instilled confidence and peace of mind through his responsiveness and attentiveness. All other stakeholders also exceeded our expectations. My mom even compared her experience at the medical center to being in London! The nursing assistant's positive attitude put our minds at ease. I highly recommend Gerocare to anyone with elderly parents in Nigeria needing medical support. You won't be disappointed—thank you, Gerocare, and keep up the great work!”"

My family is delighted with the service quality, respect, and dignity shown to my Dad, along with prompt reports and extra services like at-home investigations. Since joining Gerocare, we've noticed a positive difference in his healthcare. The organization offers flexible services, reasonable pricing, and truly listens to our needs.

Signing my mom up for Gerocare has been one of the best decisions I've made for her. Gerocare has provided me with peace of mind over the last year by taking care of her needs, from organizing a 24-hour live-in trained caregiver to arranging her routine blood tests and sending a doctor to visit her regularly, and even upon request. I highly recommend Gerocare to those of us living abroad with aging parents in Nigeria. This service is very affordable and offers excellent value. You can rest assured knowing that your parent(s) is/are well taken care of. Give them a try, and you'll thank me.”"

I discovered Gerocare on Instagram and signed up, even though their website wasn't fully functional. The MD kindly registered my mom via WhatsApp chat, and their admin was always available for assistance. They prioritized patient care over money, providing services before receiving payment. In February 2021, they significantly upgraded their platform, allowing access to test results, doctor reports, and more through email notifications and text messages. Now, with two elderly individuals signed up, I can attest to the excellent experience and continuous improvements. I highly recommend Gerocare for home care medical services at your fingertips.”"
