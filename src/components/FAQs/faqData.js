    title: "How do you ensure quality of service?",
    content:
      "In determining a doctor is a fit for a patient, after the doctor’s first visit, the elderly patient is contacted by GeroCare client services to determine how they found the doctor. If for whatever reason they are not comfortable with the doctor, that doctor would not be assigned to that patient. The doctor is also aware of this as such he has to be at his best behaviour to ensure he is able to retain that patient. Subsequently these calls after visits continue and the patients are encouraged to let us know if they are even remotely uncomfortable with the doctor and any of his actions. We fully understand that the elderly may be reluctant to report cases so we ask questions like is there any area you feel your doctor can improve on rather than asking what did you not like about the doctor or his actions. We also try as much as possible to match female doctors with female patients and male doctors with male patients. Doctors are not allowed to collect cash from patients or have access to their accounts; ATM Cards etc. or run any errands that may require money exchanging hands.",

We also have an added layer of quality assurance by assigning these doctors to a Family medicine Consultant who reviews their work online at least once a month to ensure they are doing the right things and making suggestions on areas of improvement if need be. These consultants can be anywhere as long as they have the consultant GeroCare application on their mobile devices through which they review the reports of doctors assigned to them.",

This is made possible because of the nature of our electronic records by which once a doctor is assigned to a patient.
