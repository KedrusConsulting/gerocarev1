            GeroCare was developed as a subscription-based service for parents
            and the elderly that gives them access to regular doctor home visits
            to ensure any threats to their health is discovered early and taken
            care of, and to also remind them that someone still cares enough to
            provide them with good health care services, improved quality of
            life and elderly care through our health care services. The bonus is
            that you receive regular detailed updates on their health status so

            more efficient way to manage conditions they might have.
